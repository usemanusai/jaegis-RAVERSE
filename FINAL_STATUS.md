## 🔴 What Was Wrong

Your screenshot showed:
```
raverse ❌ (red dot, no tool count)
```

**Why:** Server was hanging during initialization, blocking MCP protocol from responding to client messages.

---

## 🟢 What Was Fixed

1. **Lazy Initialization** - Defer component setup until first tool request
2. **Immediate MCP Response** - Server responds to initialize/tools/list right away
3. **All 35 Tools Exposed** - Properly discoverable by MCP clients
4. **No Timeouts** - Server no longer hangs
