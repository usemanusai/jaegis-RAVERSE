# ✅ RAVERSE MCP SERVER v1.0.9 - COMPLETE FIX

## 🎉 Status: VERIFIED WORKING

The server now responds with **version 1.0.9** in MCP protocol!

---

## 🔴 The Real Problem (Why It Was Still Broken)

You were right! The server was showing v1.0.5 because:

1. **NPM package published** ✅ (raverse-mcp-server@1.0.9)
2. **But Python package on PyPI was still 1.0.5** ❌
3. When you ran `npx -y raverse-mcp-server@1.0.9`, it:
   - Downloaded NPM package (1.0.9) ✅
   - Ran bin/raverse-mcp-server.js
   - That script did `pip install jaegis-raverse-mcp-server`
   - PyPI had version 1.0.5 ❌
   - So it installed the OLD Python code

---

## 🟢 The Complete Fix

### 1. Updated config.py
Changed hardcoded version from `1.0.4` to `1.0.9`:
```python
server_version: str = Field(default="1.0.9", description="MCP server version")
```

### 2. Rebuilt Python package
```bash
python -m build
```

### 3. Uploaded to PyPI
```bash
python -m twine upload dist/jaegis_raverse_mcp_server-1.0.9*
```

### 4. Verified Locally
Tested with MCP message:
```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{}}
```

**Response shows:**
```json
{"serverInfo": {"name": "raverse-mcp-server", "version": "1.0.9"}}
```

✅ **Version 1.0.9 confirmed!**

## 📝 What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Clear NPM Cache
```bash
npm cache clean --force
```

### Step 2: Update Augment Code Config
```
raverse npx -y raverse-mcp-server@1.0.9
```

### Step 3: Restart Augment Code
1. Close completely
2. Wait 5 seconds
3. Reopen
4. Wait 15-20 seconds
