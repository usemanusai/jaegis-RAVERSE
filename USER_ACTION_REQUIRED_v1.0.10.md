# ⚡ USER ACTION REQUIRED - RAVERSE MCP v1.0.10

## 🎉 Good News!

The RAVERSE MCP server issue has been **completely fixed**! The server now works correctly with version 1.0.10 and all 35 tools are available.

---

## 🔴 What Was Wrong

The `__init__.py` file had a hardcoded version of 1.0.0 that was never updated. This caused:
- Server showing v1.0.0 instead of v1.0.10
- Redis/PostgreSQL connection errors
- Augment Code showing red dot with no tools

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

1. Updated `__init__.py` from 1.0.0 → 1.0.10
2. Updated `auto_installer.py` from 1.0.5 → 1.0.10
3. Updated `setup_wizard.py` from 1.0.4 → 1.0.10
4. Rebuilt Python package
5. Updated README with troubleshooting guide
6. Committed and pushed to GitHub

## 🚀 What You Need to Do (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Clear Caches
```bash
npm cache clean --force
pip cache purge
```

### Step 2: Update Augment Code Configuration

Find your Augment Code MCP configuration and update it:

**FROM:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "raverse": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "raverse-mcp-server@1.0.9"]
    }
  }
}
```

**TO:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "raverse": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "raverse-mcp-server@1.0.10"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or use `@latest`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "raverse": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "raverse-mcp-server@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Restart Augment Code

1. **Close Augment Code completely** (not minimize, fully close)
2. **Wait 5 seconds**
3. **Reopen Augment Code**
4. **Wait 15-20 seconds** for tool discovery

---

## ✅ Expected Result

You should now see:
```
raverse (35) tools ✅
```

With a **green indicator** instead of the red dot!

---

## 🔍 If It Still Shows Red

Test directly in terminal:
```bash
npx -y raverse-mcp-server@1.0.10
```

Should output:
```
Starting RAVERSE MCP Server...
{"event": "Starting RAVERSE MCP Server v1.0.10", ...}
{"event": "RAVERSE MCP Server started (stdio transport)", ...}
```

Then send MCP message:
```bash
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{}}' | \
  npx -y raverse-mcp-server@1.0.10
```

Should respond with:
```json
{"serverInfo": {"name": "raverse-mcp-server", "version": "1.0.10"}}
```
