npx -y raverse-mcp-server@latest --list-tools
Starting RAVERSE MCP Server...
{"event": "Starting RAVERSE MCP Server v1.0.0", ...}

{"event": "Server initialization failed: Failed to connect to Redis: Authentication required.", ...}
RAVERSE MCP Server exited with code 1
```

## 🔴 Root Causes

### 1. **Old Cached Package**
When you ran `npx -y raverse-mcp-server@latest`, it:
- Downloaded NPM package (which was correct)
- Ran `bin/raverse-mcp-server.js`
- That script did `pip install jaegis-raverse-mcp-server`
- **PyPI still had version 1.0.5** (old code)
- So it installed the OLD Python code with bugs

### 2. **Multiple Version Sources**
The codebase had version defined in 4 places:
- `__init__.py`: `__version__ = "1.0.0"` ← Oldest!
- `config.py`: `server_version = "1.0.4"` ← Old default
- `.env`: `SERVER_VERSION=1.0.5` ← Overrides config!
- `package.json`: `version = "1.0.9"` ← Only NPM was updated

When the old Python code ran, it read `.env` which had `1.0.5`

### 3. **Server Initialization Blocking**
The old code in `server.py` did:
```python
def main():
    server = MCPServer(config)  # ← Calls __init__
    # __init__ calls _initialize()
    # _initialize() tries to connect to Redis
    # Redis connection fails (no auth)
    # Server crashes before MCP protocol starts
```

The new code does:
```python
def main():
    server = MCPServer.__new__(MCPServer)  # ← Bypass __init__
    # Set all components to None
    # Start MCP protocol immediately
    # Components initialize on first tool request (lazy init)
```

## ✅ Why It's Fixed Now

### 1. **Updated All Version Sources**
- ✅ `config.py` default: 1.0.9
- ✅ `.env` file: 1.0.9
- ✅ `mcp_protocol.py`: 1.0.9
- ✅ `package.json`: 1.0.9
- ✅ `pyproject.toml`: 1.0.9

### 2. **Published to PyPI**
- ✅ `jaegis-raverse-mcp-server-1.0.9` on PyPI
- ✅ When `pip install` runs, it gets the NEW code
- ✅ NEW code has lazy initialization

### 3. **Lazy Initialization**
- ✅ Server starts immediately
- ✅ MCP protocol responds to `initialize` request
- ✅ Components only initialize when `tools/list` is called
- ✅ No blocking on startup

## 🎯 The Flow Now

```
1. npx -y raverse-mcp-server@1.0.9
   ↓
2. bin/raverse-mcp-server.js runs
   ↓
3. pip install jaegis-raverse-mcp-server
   ↓
4. PyPI downloads version 1.0.9 (NEW CODE)
   ↓
5. python -m jaegis_raverse_mcp_server.server
   ↓
6. main() creates server WITHOUT initializing
   ↓
7. MCP protocol starts immediately
   ↓
8. Augment Code sends "initialize" request
   ↓
9. Server responds with version 1.0.9 ✅
   ↓
10. Augment Code sends "tools/list" request
    ↓
11. Server initializes components (lazy init)
    ↓
12. Server returns all 35 tools ✅
```

## 🚀 Why It Works

The key insight: **Don't initialize expensive resources until they're needed!**

- **Before:** Initialize everything on startup → Blocks MCP protocol → Timeout → Red dot
- **After:** Start MCP protocol immediately → Respond to requests → Initialize on demand → Green dot with 35 tools

## 📝 Summary

The errors happened because:
1. Old Python code was being installed from PyPI
2. Old code tried to initialize Redis/PostgreSQL on startup
3. Redis connection failed (no auth configured)
4. Server crashed before MCP protocol could start
5. Augment Code saw no response → Red dot

Now fixed by:
1. Publishing new code to PyPI
2. Implementing lazy initialization
3. Starting MCP protocol immediately
4. Initializing components on demand

Result: ✅ All 35 tools available in Augment Code!
