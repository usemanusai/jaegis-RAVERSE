## Legal Compliance

### Terms of Service

**Before using DeepCrawler, you must**:

1. **Review Target's Terms of Service**
   - Check if automated crawling is permitted
   - Respect robots.txt and crawl-delay directives
   - Comply with API usage terms

2. **Obtain Authorization**
   - Get explicit permission from website/API owner
   - Document authorization for compliance
   - Respect scope limitations

3. **Comply with Applicable Laws**
   - CFAA (Computer Fraud and Abuse Act) - USA
   - GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) - EU
   - CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) - USA
   - Local data protection laws

### robots.txt Compliance

DeepCrawler respects robots.txt directives:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /admin/
Disallow: /private/
Crawl-delay: 5
```

**DeepCrawler will**:
- ✅ Honor Disallow directives
- ✅ Respect Crawl-delay settings
- ✅ Follow User-agent specific rules
- ✅ Check for Allow directives

### Rate Limiting

**Responsible rate limiting**:

```python
from config.deepcrawler_config import DeepCrawlerConfig

# Conservative rate limiting
config = DeepCrawlerConfig(
    rate_limit=10.0,        # 10 requests per minute
    max_concurrent=2,       # 2 concurrent requests
    timeout=30              # 30 second timeout
)
```

**Guidelines**:
- Start with low rate limits (5-10 req/min)
- Monitor server response times
- Increase gradually if permitted
- Respect 429 (Too Many Requests) responses

## Ethical Guidelines

### Responsible Crawling

**Do**:
- ✅ Identify your crawler with User-Agent header
- ✅ Respect rate limits and crawl delays
- ✅ Cache responses to minimize requests
- ✅ Stop immediately if requested
- ✅ Respect privacy and data protection
- ✅ Use crawled data responsibly

**Don't**:
- ❌ Bypass authentication or access controls
- ❌ Scrape personal data without consent
- ❌ Ignore robots.txt or rate limiting
- ❌ Overload servers with requests
- ❌ Violate copyright or intellectual property
- ❌ Use data for unauthorized purposes

### Data Privacy

**Respect user privacy**:

1. **Personal Data**
   - Don't collect personal information without consent
   - Comply with GDPR/CCPA requirements
   - Implement data minimization
   - Secure collected data

2. **Sensitive Information**
   - Don't crawl authentication credentials
   - Don't collect financial information
   - Don't harvest email addresses
   - Don't extract private communications

3. **Data Retention**
   - Delete data when no longer needed
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Provide data deletion mechanisms
   - Maintain audit trails

### Intellectual Property

## Best Practices

### Pre-Crawl Checklist

Before crawling any target:

```
□ Reviewed target's Terms of Service
□ Checked robots.txt file
□ Obtained explicit authorization
□ Identified crawler with User-Agent
□ Set appropriate rate limits
□ Configured timeout values
□ Planned data retention
□ Documented business purpose
□ Reviewed applicable laws
□ Tested on small scale first
```

### Implementation Best Practices

```python
from agents.online_deepcrawler_agent import DeepCrawlerAgent
from config.deepcrawler_config import DeepCrawlerConfig
import logging

# Setup logging for audit trail
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler('deepcrawler_audit.log'),
        logging.StreamHandler()
    ]
)

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Configure responsibly
config = DeepCrawlerConfig(
    max_depth=2,            # Shallow crawl
    max_urls=100,           # Limited scope
    max_concurrent=2,       # Low concurrency
    timeout=30,             # Reasonable timeout
    rate_limit=10.0         # Conservative rate
)

# Initialize with logging
crawler = DeepCrawlerAgent(config=config)

# Log crawl activity
logger.info(f"Starting crawl of {target_url}")
logger.info(f"Config: depth={config.max_depth}, rate={config.rate_limit}")

try:
    result = crawler.execute({
        "target_url": target_url,
        "max_depth": 2
    })
    
    logger.info(f"Crawl complete: {result['urls_crawled']} URLs, {result['apis_discovered']} APIs")
    
    # Log errors
    if result['errors']:
        for error in result['errors']:
            logger.warning(f"Error at {error['url']}: {error['error']}")
    
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Crawl failed: {e}")
    crawler.cancel_crawl()
```

### Monitoring and Compliance

**Monitor crawl activity**:

```python
# Check status regularly
status = crawler.get_crawl_status()

# Verify compliance
if status['urls_crawled'] > config.max_urls:
    logger.warning("Exceeded max_urls limit")
    crawler.pause_crawl()

# Respect rate limits
if status['errors'] > 10:
    logger.warning("High error rate, reducing rate limit")
    crawler.pause_crawl()
```
