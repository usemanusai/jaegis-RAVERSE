```bash
python main.py test.exe --no-database
```
- [ ] Application runs in standalone mode
- [ ] Analysis completes successfully

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Functional Tests

#### Test 1: Configuration Display
```bash
python main.py --config
```
- [ ] Configuration displays correctly
- [ ] All settings show expected values

#### Test 2: Database Connectivity
```bash
# Run with database mode
python main.py test.exe
```
- [ ] Connects to PostgreSQL successfully
- [ ] Connects to Redis successfully
- [ ] Analysis completes
- [ ] Results cached

#### Test 3: Cache Verification
```bash
# Run same binary again
python main.py test.exe
```
- [ ] Cache hit detected in logs
- [ ] Analysis completes faster (<1 second)

#### Test 4: Standalone Mode
```bash
python main.py test.exe --no-database
```
- [ ] Runs without database connection
- [ ] Uses in-memory cache
- [ ] Analysis completes successfully

### Performance Tests

#### Test 5: Response Time
- [ ] First analysis: 5-15 seconds (acceptable)
- [ ] Cached analysis: <1 second (acceptable)
- [ ] LLM API call: 2-5 seconds (acceptable)

#### Test 6: Resource Usage
```bash
docker stats
```

# Linux/macOS
chmod +x scripts/run_tests.sh
./scripts/run_tests.sh --all --coverage
```
