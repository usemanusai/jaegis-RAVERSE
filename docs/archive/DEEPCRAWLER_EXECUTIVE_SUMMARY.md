## 🎨 ARCHITECTURE HIGHLIGHTS

### Multi-Agent System
```
DeepCrawlerAgent (Orchestrator)
├── NavigationAgent (Explore app)
├── NetworkAnalysisAgent (Intercept traffic)
├── CodeAnalysisAgent (Parse JavaScript)
└── DocumentationAgent (Generate OpenAPI)
```

### API Discovery Pipeline
```
Navigation → Network Monitoring → Code Analysis → Classification → Documentation
```

### Intelligent Prioritization
```
Priority = (depth_score × 0.5) + (pattern_score × 0.3) + (recency_score × 0.2)
```

### State Management
```
Memory System → PostgreSQL Database → Redis (distributed)
```
