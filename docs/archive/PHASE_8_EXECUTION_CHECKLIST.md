- ✅ No failures
- ✅ No errors

### Step 2: Run Integration Tests (10 minutes)
```bash
python -m pytest tests/integration/ -v --tb=short
```

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] All 30 integration tests pass
- [ ] No errors or warnings
- [ ] All integrations tested

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ 30/30 tests pass
- ✅ No failures
- ✅ No errors

### Step 3: Run End-to-End Tests (10 minutes)
```bash
python -m pytest tests/e2e/ -v --tb=short
```

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] All 24 E2E tests pass
- [ ] No errors or warnings
- [ ] All workflows tested

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ 24/24 tests pass
- ✅ No failures
- ✅ No errors

### Step 4: Run All Tests with Coverage (15 minutes)
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v --cov=agents --cov-report=html --cov-report=term
```

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] All 166+ tests pass
- [ ] Code coverage >85%
- [ ] HTML coverage report generated

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ 166+/166+ tests pass
- ✅ Coverage >85%
- ✅ htmlcov/index.html generated

### Step 5: Verify Coverage (5 minutes)
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=agents --cov-report=term-missing | grep -E 'TOTAL|agents'
```

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Coverage >85% for all agents
- [ ] All critical paths covered

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Coverage >85%
- ✅ All agents covered

## FAILURE HANDLING

### If Unit Tests Fail
1. [ ] Identify failing test
2. [ ] Review test code
3. [ ] Review agent code
4. [ ] Fix the issue
5. [ ] Re-run test
6. [ ] Verify fix

### If Integration Tests Fail
1. [ ] Check database connection
2. [ ] Check Redis connection
3. [ ] Check LLM API key
4. [ ] Review error message
5. [ ] Fix the issue

### If E2E Tests Fail
1. [ ] Review workflow
2. [ ] Check dependencies
3. [ ] Review error message
4. [ ] Fix the issue
5. [ ] Re-run test

### If Coverage < 85%
1. [ ] Identify uncovered code
2. [ ] Write additional tests
3. [ ] Re-run coverage
