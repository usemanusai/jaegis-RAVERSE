## 🎯 Key Clarifications Implemented

### Critical Distinction: "Online" vs "Offline"

**BEFORE:** Ambiguous terminology, unclear what "online" meant

**AFTER:** Crystal clear distinction

```
✅ RAVERSE Online = Desktop app (runs LOCALLY) → Analyzes REMOTE/ONLINE targets
✅ RAVERSE Offline = Desktop app (runs LOCALLY) → Analyzes LOCAL targets

Both editions are LOCAL applications.
The difference is WHERE the analysis targets are located.
```

This clarification appears in:
- README-Online.md (prominent warning box)
- README-Offline.md (prominent warning box)
- Comparison tables in both files
- Architecture diagrams
